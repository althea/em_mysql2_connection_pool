h1. EmMysql2ConnectionPool

EmMysql2ConnectionPool generation a pool of MySQL2 connection with the given parameters. If you execute queries on the pool these queries get cued and executed using the next free connection.

Usage:

<pre><code>conf = {
    :host => "localhost",
    :database => 'my_db',
    :reconnect => true,
    :username => "root",
    # :password => ''
}

my_query = "SELECT * FROM track WHERE in_progress != 0 LIMIT 10"

Mysql2::Client.default_query_options.merge! :symbolize_keys => true, :cast_booleans => true

MySQL = EmMysql2ConnectionPool.new conf

EM.run do
  MySQL.query my_query do |results|
    results.each do |result|
      p result
    end
    EM.stop
  end
end
</code></pre>

Go ahead, try the example.

h2. Advanced usage

Sometimes you need the connection within the query. For example if you want to SQL-escape a string. But when building the query with EmMysql2ConnectionPool you don't have a connection at hand as your query just gets cued. Therefor you can wrap your query into a block which only parameter will be the actual connection executing the query:

<pre><code>MySQL.query proc{ |conn|
  escaped_name = conn.escape some_string
  "SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE name is '#{escaped_name}'"
}</code></pre>
